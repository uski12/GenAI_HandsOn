        "# Unit 2 Assignment: Building a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Router\n",
        "\n",
        "**Topic:** Advanced Architecture using Groq API  \n",
        "**Estimated Time:** 45-60 Minutes  \n",
        "**Tools:** Python, Groq API, Dotenv\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Objective\n",
        "Your task is to build a **\"Smart Customer Support Router\"** using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a real-world company, you don't want a \"Generalist\" AI handling everything. You want:\n",
        "1.  A **Technical Expert** for bug reports.\n",
        "2.  A **Billing Expert** for refund requests.\n",
        "3.  A **Sales Expert** for new inquiries.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will build a **Router** that takes a user query, decides which expert is best suited for it, and then forwards the query to that specific expert configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🛠️ Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Setup\n",
        "- Install `groq` and `python-dotenv`.\n",
        "- Set up your Groq API Key (variable: `GROQ_API_KEY`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Define Your Experts\n",
        "Create a configuration dictionary `MODEL_CONFIG` where you define your experts.\n",
        "*Note: Since we are using the Groq API, we can simulate different \"experts\" by using different **System Prompts** while using the same base model (e.g., `mixtral-8x7b-32768`).*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Technical Expert:** System prompt should be rigorous, code-focused, and precise.\n",
        "- **Billing Expert:** System prompt should be empathetic, financial-focused, and policy-driven.\n",
        "- **General Expert:** A fallback for casual chat.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. The Router (The Core Task)\n",
        "Write a function `route_prompt(user_input)` that uses an LLM call to classify the intent.\n",
        "- Input: User's query string.\n",
        "- Output: The **Category Name** (e.g., \"technical\", \"billing\", \"general\").\n",
        "- **Constraint:** The router must return *only* the category name, nothing else.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. The Orchestrator\n",
        "Write a main function `process_request(user_input)` that:\n",
        "1.  Calls `route_prompt` to decide the category.\n",
        "2.  Selects the correct **System Prompt** based on the category.\n",
        "3.  Calls the generic LLM (Mixtral) with that specific System Prompt + User Input.\n",
        "4.  Returns the final answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📝 Example Output\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:**\n",
        "> \"My python script is throwing an IndexError on line 5.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logic:**\n",
        "1.  **Router** sees \"Python\", \"IndexError\" -> Classifies as **\"technical\"**.\n",
        "2.  **Orchestrator** loads the \"Technical Expert\" system prompt.\n",
        "3.  **Expert** responds with a code fix.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:**\n",
        "> \"I was charged twice for my subscription this month.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Logic:**\n",
        "1.  **Router** sees \"charged\", \"subscription\" -> Classifies as **\"billing\"**.\n",
        "2.  **Orchestrator** loads the \"Billing Expert\" system prompt.\n",
        "3.  **Expert** responds with refund policy info.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💡 Hints\n",
        "- Use `temperature=0` for the Router (you want consistency).\n",
        "- Use `temperature=0.7` for the Experts (you want creativity/flexibility).\n",
        "- Your routing prompt should be very clear: *\"Classify this text into one of these categories: [technical, billing, general]. Return ONLY the word.\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Bonus Challenge\n",
        "Can you add a **\"Tool Use\"** expert?\n",
        "If the user asks for \"current price of Bitcoin\", route it to a function that (mock) fetches data, instead of just an LLM response.\n",
